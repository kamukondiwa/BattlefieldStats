Battlefield stats 3.

A small chrome extension that consumes a battlefield 3 gaming statistics public api from (http://bf3stats.com/).

A current version of the extension can be found on the chrome webstore (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/battlefield-3-stats/caklhgcfinmobcokbndjdeekceppbaen)

I started this project as an excuse to dive into the chrome api.
